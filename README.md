# Algorithm-Selection-Tool


A Python based tool to select and implement a machine learning/deep learning algorithm given the problem statement (yes, literally) and the data (cleaned at first, will implement cleaner tool soon). 

The plan is to modularize several algorithms as well as the entire general training/testing pipeline, and implement a NLP-backed algorithm to understand and match problem statements with the most suitable algorithm, then run it through an auto-optimization script, eventually to output a trained model that will be able to predict well.
