As of right now:

raw data -> dtypes, columns, target variable column -> check dependencies -> remove columns with low dependency to target variable -> check NaN counts -> remove NaNs conditionally -> columnize 

This should be enough for now. 
I've already implemented:
1. dtypes, columns, target variable column
2. checking nan counts 
3. columnization 

Implementing the rest.
